# Bidder

[My Notes](notes.md)

Website that allows sellers to list items that people may show intrest in by bidding and if enough bids go through the seller must create and ship the product out to the buyers. If not enough bids are placed then no one has to pay for anything.



## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable
For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [X] Description of key features

- [X] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Imagine a website that allows for a item to be put up by a seller needing a minumun quantity to be sold before producing. Now imagine clients who want to look for things to buy and also get discount, this website will fufill both sides of this allowing sellers to see what people want to buy, and buyers can purchase things they find cool.

### Design

Here is a sequence diagram that shows how to sellers and buyers would interact with the backend to list and buy items.
